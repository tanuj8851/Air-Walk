 AirWalk , the US company that sells colourful plastic clogs, has decided to overlook India as a manufacturing hub as it shuts down all company-owned factories and looks to outsource manufacturing to streamline operations.
All AirWalk™ shoes are uniquely designed and manufactured using the company's proprietary closed-cell resin, Croslite™, a technology that gives each pair of shoes the soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking and odor-resistant qualities that AirWalk wearers know and love.
